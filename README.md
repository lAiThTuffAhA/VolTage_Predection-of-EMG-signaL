# VolTage_Predection-of-EMG-signaLthe true muscle effort represents the actual or ground truth effort of the muscle. It is derived from the original EMG data used to create the dataset. The true muscle effort values are used as the target variable (or label) when training and evaluating the model.

The model is a deep learning neural network designed to predict muscle effort from EMG signals. The model takes preprocessed EMG signals as input and outputs the predicted muscle effort. The output of the model is an estimate of the muscle effort based on the input EMG signals.

When evaluating the model and plot the results, we compare the true muscle effort (the actual muscle effort values) with the predicted muscle effort (the model's estimates).

If we want to convert the predicted muscle effort to voltage, we can define a scaling factor that represents the relationship between muscle effort and voltage. This scaling factor can be used to convert the predicted muscle effort to the corresponding voltage values.

i had assumed that the relationship between the effort and the voltage is linear.
